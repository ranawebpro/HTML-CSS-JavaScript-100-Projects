## My first 100+ HTML-CSS-JavaScript projects (2021-2022) 

Whether you're a fellow developer reminiscing about your own first projects or a beginner eager to dive into HTML and CSS, these projects are not just a showcase but an invitation for you. Feel free to leverage these projects as a hands-on learning resource and a practice ground in various ways. I've shared these projects to help you become as familiar and more comfortable with HTML-CSS-JavaScript as I have become! So, stay motivated, keep coding, and remember, every coding challenge is a step closer to becoming a coding superhero! ðŸš€
